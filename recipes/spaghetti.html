  	<p>Spaghetti (Italian: [spaˈɡetti]) is a long, thin, solid, cylindrical pasta. It is a staple food of traditional Italian cuisine. Like other pasta, spaghetti is made of milled wheat and water and   		sometimes enriched with vitamins and minerals. Italian spaghetti is typically made from durum wheat semolina.
  	 Usually the pasta is white because refined flour is used, but whole wheat flour may be added. Spaghettoni is a thicker form of spaghetti, while capellini is a very thin spaghetti.
	</p>
	
	<p>Originally, spaghetti was notably long, but shorter lengths gained in popularity during the latter half of the 20th century and now it is most commonly available in 25–30 cm (10–12 in) lengths. A 		variety of pasta dishes are based on it and it is frequently served with tomato sauce or meat or vegetables.
