  	<p>SA nontraditional approach to a potato latke. The shredding is done using a spiralizer, and the apple and maple syrup give you just enough sweetness to make these different. Good topped with sour 		cream or applesauce.

	<h3> Ingredients: </h3>
	<ul>
	<li> 1 russet potato, peeled  </li>
    	<li> 1 firm apple, peeled  </li>
    	<li> S1 egg, lightly beaten  </li>
	<li> 3 tablespoons all-purpose flour  </li>
	<li> 1 teaspoon maple syrup  </li>
	<li> Â½ teaspoon sea salt  </li>
	<li> 1 pinch ground nutmeg   </li>
	<li> 2 tablespoons vegetable oil, or as needed   </li>
	</ul>
	
	<h3> Steps: </h3>
	<ol>
	<li> Make a deep vertical cut on each side of the potato and apple. </li>
    	<li> Attach potato to a spiralizer fitted with the small shredded blade and cut into thin shreds. Repeat with apple. Spread shredded potato and apple on several layers of paper towels; squeeze to 		release as much moisture as possible. Transfer to a bowl.</li>
    	<li> Mix egg, flour, maple syrup, salt, and nutmeg into the bowl.</li>
    	<li> Heat vegetable oil in a skillet over medium heat. Spoon 2 tablespoons of the potato mixture into the skillet; flatten slightly with a spatula. Cook until golden brown, 3 to 4 minutes per side. 		Drain on a plate lined with paper towels. Repeat with remaining mixture, adding more oil if needed.</li>
	</ol>
