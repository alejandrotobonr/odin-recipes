  	<p>Bandeja Paisa is probably the most popular Colombian dish, originally from the Andean region of the country where the people are called “Paisas” and the area where I was born and raised..

	<ol>
	<li> Prepare the beans, hogao and powdered beef one day ahead and keep in the refrigerator. </li>
    	<li> When you are going to serve the bandeja paisa, heat the beans and powdered beef and hogao. Make the chicharrones.</li>

    	<li> Fry the eggs and chorizos.</li>
    	<li> To serve, place the rice in a tray or platter and place the rest of the ingredients as you like. 
    	I prefer the beans in a separate bowl, but you can ladle the beans next to the rice if you like. </li>
    	<li> Bring the hogao in a serving dish to the table, so people can place it on top of the beans if they like.</li>
